V8Js is a PHP extension for Google's V8 Javascript engine.

The extension allows you to execute Javascript code in a secure sandbox from PHP. The executed code
can be restricted using a time limit and/or memory limit. This provides the possibility to execute
untrusted code with confidence.


Minimum requirements
--------------------

- V8 Javascript Engine library (libv8) master <https://github.com/v8/v8-git-mirror> (trunk)

	V8 is Google's open source Javascript engine.
	V8 is written in C++ and is used in Google Chrome, the open source browser from Google.
	V8 implements ECMAScript as specified in ECMA-262, 5th edition.

	This extension requires V8 6.9 (6.9.427.18 is known to work) or higher.

    V8 releases are published rather quickly and the V8 team usually provides security support
    for the version line shipped with the Chrome browser (stable channel) and newer (only).
    For a version overview see https://omahaproxy.appspot.com/.

- PHP 7.0.0+

  This embedded implementation of the V8 engine uses thread locking so it works with ZTS enabled.


Windows is currently *not* officially supported.  Mostly since I don't have the time to
maintain support for it myself, and don't really have Windows boxes to try things with.
It would be great if someone could step up and fix things on Windows, provide pre-build V8
binaries, etc.


Pre-built binaries
------------------

For some very first steps, instead of compiling manually you might want to try out the [V8Js docker
image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/stesie/v8js/).  It has v8, v8js and php-cli pre-installed
so you can give it a try with PHP in "interactive mode".  There is no Apache, etc. running however.


Compiling latest version
------------------------

Building on Microsoft Windows is a bit more involved, see README.Win32.md file
for a quick run through.  Building on GNU/Linux and MacOS X is straight forward,
see README.Linux.md and README.MacOS.md files for a walk through with platform
specific notes.

Javascript API
==============

```js
    // Print a string.
    print(string);

    // Dump the contents of a variable.
    var_dump(value);

    // Terminate Javascript execution immediately.
    exit();

    // CommonJS Module support to require external code.
    // This makes use of the PHP module loader provided via V8Js::setModuleLoader (see PHP API above).
    require("path/to/module");
```

The JavaScript `in` operator, when applied to a wrapped PHP object,
works the same as the PHP `isset()` function.  Similarly, when applied
to a wrapped PHP object, JavaScript `delete` works like PHP `unset`.

```php
<?php
class Foo {
  var $bar = null;
}
$v8 = new V8Js();
$v8->foo = new Foo;
// This prints "no"
$v8->executeString('print( "bar" in PHP.foo ? "yes" : "no" );');
?>
```

PHP has separate namespaces for properties and methods, while JavaScript
has just one.  Usually this isn't an issue, but if you need to you can use
a leading `$` to specify a property, or `__call` to specifically invoke a
method.

```php
<?php
class Foo {
	var $bar = "bar";
	function bar($what) { echo "I'm a ", $what, "!\n"; }
}

$foo = new Foo;
// This prints 'bar'
echo $foo->bar, "\n";
// This prints "I'm a function!"
$foo->bar("function");

$v8 = new V8Js();
$v8->foo = new Foo;
// This prints 'bar'
$v8->executeString('print(PHP.foo.$bar, "\n");');
// This prints "I'm a function!"
$v8->executeString('PHP.foo.__call("bar", ["function"]);');
?>
```

Mapping Rules
=============

PHP and JavaScript data types don't match exactly.  This is of course both languages have
data types to handle numbers.  Yet PHP differentiates between integers and floating point
numbers contrary JavaScript only has a type `Number`, which is a IEEE 754 floating point
number.  In many cases this doesn't matter at all, when both languages can represent the
same number well.  However there are edge cases.

On 64-bit systems PHP allows integers to have 64 significant bits, JavaScripts number type
(i.e. IEEE 754) however has 52 bit mantissa only.  Hence some precission will be lost.  This
starts to matter if you pass around integer values with more then 15 accurate decimal digits.


Native Arrays
-------------

Despite the common name the concept of arrays is very different between PHP and JavaScript.  In JavaScript an array is a contiguous collection of elements indexed by integral numbers from zero on upwards.  In PHP arrays can be sparse, i.e. integral keys need not be contiguous and may even be negative.  Besides PHP arrays may not only use integral numbers as keys but also strings (so-called associative arrays).  Contrary JavaScript arrays allow for properties to be attached to arrays, which isn't supported by PHP.  Those properties are not part of the arrays collection, for example `Array.prototype.forEach` method doesn't "see" these.

Generally PHP arrays are mapped to JavaScript "native" arrays if this is possible, i.e. the PHP array uses contiguous numeric keys from zero on upwards.  Both associative and sparse arrays are mapped to JavaScript objects.  Those objects have a constructor also called "Array", but they are not native arrays and don't share the Array.prototype, hence they don't (directly) support the typical array functions like `join`, `forEach`, etc.
PHP arrays are immediately exported value by value without live binding.  This is if you change a value on JavaScript side or push further values onto the array, this change is *not* reflected on PHP side.

If JavaScript arrays are passed back to PHP the JavaScript array is always converted to a PHP array.  If the JavaScript array has (own) properties attached, these are also converted to keys of the PHP array.


Native Objects
--------------

PHP objects passed to JavaScript are mapped to native JavaScript objects which have a "virtual" constructor function with the name of the PHP object's class.  This constructor function can be used to create new instances of the PHP class as long as the PHP class doesn't have a non-public `__construct` method.
All public methods and properties are visible to JavaScript code and the properties are live-bound, i.e. if a property's value is changed by JavaScript code, the PHP object is also affected.

If a native JavaScript object is passed to PHP the JavaScript object is mapped to a PHP object of `V8Object` class.  This object has all properties the JavaScript object has and is fully mutable.  If a function is assigned to one of those properties, it's also callable by PHP code.
The `executeString` function can be configured to always map JavaScript objects to PHP arrays by setting the `V8Js::FLAG_FORCE_ARRAY` flag.  Then the standard array behaviour applies that values are not live-bound, i.e. if you change values of the resulting PHP array, the JavaScript object is *not* affected.


PHP Objects implementing ArrayAccess, Countable
-----------------------------------------------

The above rule that PHP objects are generally converted to JavaScript objects also applies to PHP objects of `ArrayObject` type or other classes, that implement both the `ArrayAccess` and the `Countable` interface -- even so they behave like PHP arrays.

This behaviour can be changed by enabling the php.ini flag `v8js.use_array_access`.  If set, objects of PHP classes that implement the aforementioned interfaces are converted to JavaScript Array-like objects.  This is by-index access of this object results in immediate calls to the `offsetGet` or `offsetSet` PHP methods (effectively this is live-binding of JavaScript against the PHP object).  Such an Array-esque object also supports calling every attached public method of the PHP object + methods of JavaScript's native Array.prototype methods (as long as they are not overloaded by PHP methods).

Snapshots
=========

First of all snapshots are incompatible with extensions. So when you see

    #
    # Fatal error in ../src/snapshot/startup-serializer.cc, line 122
    # Check failed: !isolate->has_installed_extensions().
    #

you need to remove all extension registrations.

First of all [custom startup snapshots](https://v8project.blogspot.de/2015/09/custom-startup-snapshots.html)
is a feature provided by V8 itself, built on top of it's general heap snapshots feature.  The idea is that, since
it is quite common to load some JavaScript library prior to any actual work to be done, that this library code
is also baked into the heap snapshot.

This extension provides an easy way to create those customized snapshots.  In order to create such a snapshot
with a `fibonacci` function baked into it, just call `V8Js::createSnapshot` statically like this:

```php
    $snapshot = V8Js::createSnapshot('var fibonacci = n => n < 3 ? 1 : fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)');
```

Then persist the contents of `$snapshot` to whereever you like, e.g. the local file system or maybe Redis.

If you need to create a new V8Js instance, simply pass the snapshot as 5th argument to the V8Js constructor:

```php
    $jscript = new V8Js('php', array(), array(), true, $snapshot);
    echo $jscript->executeString('fibonacci(43)') . "\n";
```

Keep in mind, that the code to be included in the snapshot may not directly call any of the functions exported
from PHP, since they are added right *after* the snapshot code is run.

Exceptions
==========

If the JavaScript code throws (without catching), causes errors or doesn't
compile, `V8JsScriptException` exceptions are thrown unless the `V8Js` object
is constructed with `report_uncaught_exceptions` set `FALSE`.

PHP exceptions that occur due to calls from JavaScript code by default are
*not* re-thrown into JavaScript context but cause the JavaScript execution to
be stopped immediately and then are reported at the location calling the JS code.

This behaviour can be changed by setting the `FLAG_PROPAGATE_PHP_EXCEPTIONS`
flag.  If it is set, PHP exception (objects) are converted to JavaScript
objects obeying the above rules and re-thrown in JavaScript context.  If they
are not caught by JavaScript code the execution stops and a
`V8JsScriptException` is thrown, which has the original PHP exception accessible
via `getPrevious` method.

Inspector Client
================

Keep in mind that this is an experimental feature of php-v8js.

The inspector client API, i.e. calling `V8Js::connectInspector()`, provides
low-level access to [V8's Inspector Protocol](https://v8.dev/docs/inspector).
This may be used to access V8's profiler.

Theoretically this also provides access to V8's debugger.  Yet keep in mind
that setting a breakpoint in the JavaScript code will also block PHP code
execution (due to php-v8js' call model).

See [Chrome DevTool Protocol API documentation](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/1-3/Profiler/)
for details on how to use the profiler.

Usage example to collect call count information on function level:

```php
<?php

$v8 = new V8Js;
$i = $v8->connectInspector();

$i->setResponseHandler(function($res) {
        $res = \json_decode($res);

        if ($res->id === 3) {
                foreach($res->result->result[0]->functions as $info) {
                        printf("function '%s' was called %d times.\n", $info->functionName ?: '<root scope>', $info->ranges[0]->count);
                }
        }
});

$i->send(json_encode([ 'id' => 1, 'method' => "Profiler.enable" ]));
$i->send(json_encode([ 'id' => 2, 'method' => "Profiler.startPreciseCoverage", 'params' => [ 'callCount' => true ] ]));

$fn = $v8->executeString('(function foo() { const blarg = 42; })', 'multi-call-lambda');

$fn();
$fn();
$fn();

$i->send(json_encode([ 'id' => 3, 'method' => "Profiler.takePreciseCoverage" ]));
```

yields

```
function '<root scope>' was called 1 times.
function 'foo' was called 3 times.
```
